# GraphicEngineOpenGL  

The goal of this project is first to be more familiar with cmake and C++ environments, but also learn the graphic pipeline and low, "behind the hood" code of graphics pipeline with OpenGL.


## To build & run :
Install cmake on your machine if not already done

`cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build --config Release && ./build/LocalBuild/GraphicEngineOpenGL`
